<h1>Best Bikes</h1>
<p>Here are some of the best bikes you can choose from right now.</p>
<h2>Kawasaki H2</h2>
<p>You might not be very comfortable riding the H2, but at least you won't have to be on it for very long, because the H2 is the fastest production sportsbike available today.

<h2>Harley Davidson FXR</h2>
<p>This cruiser style motorcycle is great fun and surprisingly comfortable!  It's not a sportsbike, but it can still be ridden almost as quickly, all while sitting on a nice comfy seat.</p>

<h2>Suzuki Gladius 650</h2>
<p>This smaller motorcycle is a great starter bike and compromise between sportsbike and cruiser.  It's less aggressive seating position allows for more comfort while still being able to lean into turns a lot harder than a cruiser could.</p>
