<h1>Dangers of Riding</h1>
<p>Riding motorcycles involves many dangers.  Traffic, road debris, and even your own riding ability can all cause you to crash and have a bad time.</p>
<h2>Traffic dangers</h2>
<p>Other cars are usually the number one most dangerous thing to a motorcyclist on the road. They can suddenly change lanes and hit you off your bike within a fraction of a second.  It's advised to slow and use extreme caution around traffic or any single vehicle on the road.</p>

<h2>Road debris</h2>
<p>Rocks, potholes, sand, gravel, leaves, trees, and even deer are common forms of road debris encounted by motorcyclists.  All of these things can easily lead to a crash, especially at night when it's much harder to examine the road ahead, and especially around turns.</p>
<h2>Self-evaluated riding ability</h2>

<p>This one can get you into a lot of trouble.  Confidence of how well you're able to control the bike in certain situations can be severly over-estimated or misjudged.  Crashes often happen because the rider goes as fast as possible, not leaving any room for error or changing external factors, which inevitably leads to a loss of control, and ususally a crash.</p>
